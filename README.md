💡 IoT-Based Real-Time Health Monitoring System Using ESP32

🚑 A smart health monitoring system using **ESP32**, **MAX30104** (heart rate), and **MLX90614** (temperature) sensors.  
📡 It collects vital health data and displays it live on a **local web dashboard** — no internet required!

---

 🔍 Overview

This project helps monitor a person's **heart rate 💓** and **body temperature 🌡️** in real-time.  
Using ESP32's Wi-Fi capability, a web server is hosted directly from the microcontroller, showing data instantly on any connected browser.
